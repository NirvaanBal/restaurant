An SPA built in vanilla JS powered by webpack. [Live here](https://nirvaanbal.github.io/restaurant/).

## Features

- Tabbed Navigation like a server side application 🤩
- Webpack used to bundle JS 🗳️

### Raison d'être

The aim behind this project was to learn using modern JS practices like ES6 modules and bundle handling.
